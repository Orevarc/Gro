<b>Running the server</b>
<p><u>On Windows:</u></p>
<p>Download NodeJS from:</p>
```
http://nodejs.org/download/
```

Once installed, open an <i>administrative</i> cmd.exe and run:

```
npm -g install sails
```

In your cmd line navigate into the 'API' folder. Once there run:

```
sails lift
```

If it asks you to enter in a number, enter 1.

The server is now running on:
```
localhost:1337/
```

Enter that URL into your browser and see if you get a webpage. Now you know the server is running.
